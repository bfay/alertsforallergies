<!--*************************This is where you put the extended information about the product.  It is the width of the page underneath everything, just like petunia.com (remove the quotes too)***************************--><div class="product-more thirteen columns centered"><p>These trendy and durable lunch bags are made of poly canvas material and have a heat sealed PEVA liner that can hold ice. They're convenient to use with their zippered main compartment and adjustable shoulder strap. The clear card pocket holds vital allergy information and the front flap has a velcro closure with mesh slip pocket, whichÂ is great for holding wet wipes to ensure allergy-free hands before eating.</p>

<p>A great visual reminder to lunch aides, fellow students and teachers that will help them remember to keep this lunch bag away from other lunch bags. Bright Red with Allergy Alert logo draws attention but still looks cool! Also, perfect to use as a medicine kit bag - convenient to take places and leave with caregivers. Holds your child's essential medicine, allergy action plan, wet wipes, tattoos, and more.</p>
